Associative and sequential containers differ from one another in a fundamental way: Elements in an
associative container are stored and retrieved by a key. In contrast, elements in a sequential con-tainer are stored and accessed sequentially by their position in the container.
Although the associative containers share much of the behavior of the sequential containers, they differ from the sequential containers in ways that reflect the use of keys.
